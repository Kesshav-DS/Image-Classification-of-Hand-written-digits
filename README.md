# Image-Classification-of-Hand-written-digits
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset, a classic benchmark for image classification, contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9), each in grayscale and sized 28x28 pixels.
