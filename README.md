# Image-Classification-of-Hand-written-digits
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset, a classic benchmark for image classification, contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9), each in grayscale and sized 28x28 pixels.

Here's a description you can use for your GitHub project:

# Features:
- Dataset Preprocessing: The MNIST dataset is loaded, normalized, and prepared for training and testing the CNN model.
- CNN Architecture: A deep learning model built using convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers to achieve high accuracy in digit classification.
- Model Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the MNIST training set and evaluated on the test set, with metrics like accuracy, precision, and loss reported.
- Visualization: Includes visualizations of model performance, such as accuracy and loss plots, and examples of misclassified images to analyze errors.

# Requirements:
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

# How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the training script to train the model.
4. Use the trained model to classify new images.

This project is an ideal introduction to CNNs and image classification, offering insights into deep learning techniques for anyone interested in computer vision.
